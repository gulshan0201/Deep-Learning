## What  is forward propogation?
Forward propagation is the process in a neural network where input data moves sequentially from the input layer, through hidden layers, to the output layer to generate a prediction, using weights, biases, and activation functions at each step. It's essentially the "doing" part of a network, where data flows in one direction to compute an output, forming the basis for training when paired with backpropagation to adjust parameters.
